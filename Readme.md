## Introduction

Message driven architecture puts in interaction client applications with services replying to the requests from client applications.
Some of advantages of message driven architecture is the scalability with loadbalencing, and the asynchronous communication.
This type of architecture is based on a broker allowing to subscribe to a topic and publish messages.

In this sample we show how to use IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM) with Apache Kafka which is a distributed streaming plateform allowing to setup a message driven architecture.
![Sample Architecture](docs/images/architecture.png)


In the sample architecture, we have Client Applications sending a loan request and Decision Services executing the loan request against a ruleset, for more information about the loan validation sample, see the References section.
Message driven architecture 
We have one kafka broker and two topics in the sample architecture.
The first topic is for Client Applications to put their loan request, and the second topic is for replies where the Decision Services put the result after executing against a ruleset.
All the Decision Services have the same kafka consumer group, and Client Applications have different consumer groups.  


### Workflow Description


1. N Client applications act as kafka Producer and send their payload to the topic named Requests.

2. M Decision Services implementing ODM which act as a Kafka consumer and execute the payload.

3. After executing the payload against the ruleset, the Decision Services act as a Kafka producer and put the json result in the topic named Replies.

4. The Client Applications act as Kafka consumer and get the message corresponding to the result of his request.

## Requirements

* Apache Kafka 2.11
* IBM Operational Decision Manager 8.9.2
* Apache Maven 3

## Before starting
* Make sure that you have kafka installed, and start kafka by launching zookeeper and kafka-server.
* Clone the project repository from github.
`$ git clone --branch=odm-integration git@github.ibm.com:MYattara/ODM-DecisionServer-JSE-Kafka.git`
* In the pom file, set the property `<ibm.odm.install.dir></ibm.odm.install.dir>` with your odm installation directory, ` For example : <ibm.odm.install.dir>C:\ODM8920</ibm.odm.install.dir>`

If you have a shell command line
* Create the kafka topic for request : `$ kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 2 --topic requests`
* Create the kafka topic for replies : `$ kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 2 --topic replies`


If you have a Windows command line

* Create the kafka topic for request : `$ kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 2 --topic requests`
* Create the kafka topic for replies : `$ kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 2 --topic replies`


## Building the source code
Use the following Maven command to build the source code.
`$ mvn clean install`

## Scenario Running

According to the sub-scenario we'll use several Client Applications sending one or many payload to several Decision Services.
the Client Application is a JSE Application that sends a payload with information about the borrower and the loan Request, and waits for the approval or a reject of his loan request.
The Decision Service is a JSE ODM execution server in-memory persistence application, which executes the payload against ODM loan validation sample ruleset and returns a result (approved or rejected) to the JSE Client Application.

-   [Scenario 1 : Two Client Applications sending payload to one Decision Service and waiting for the result](docs/chapters/subscenario1.md)
-   [Scenario 2 : One Client Application Sending several payload to N Decision Services](docs/chapters/subscenario2.md)
-   [Scenario 3 : Availability after one Decision Service is down](docs/chapters/subscenario3.md)
